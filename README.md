<h6 align="center">Toy Feistel Network Encryption and Decryption</h3>


# What is it?
Feisty is a toy implementation of a Feistel Network. I might work more on making it actually usable, but who knows. I do not recommend serious use.

# Dependencies
Nothing too wild, just C++ libraries including:
iostream - IO
fstream - file manipulation
stdexcept - exceptions
queue - queue data structure
bitset - converting to binary
string - strings
algorithm - for reversing the key

# Contributing
Submit a PR if you want. Please comment your code if you do, but it's not a deal breaker. Submit what you got. 

# Disclaimer
This thing has bugs and Feistel Networks are outdated. I did this in a night cause I thought it would be fun. DO NOT TRUST IT FOR SERIOUS CRYPTOGRAPHY.
I will eventually be doing my own somewhat-more-legitimate implementations of cryptographically secure protocols, such as RSA and ElGamal (potentially even with Elliptic Curve Groups!) along with publishing my abbreviated notes on cryptography. Look out for that in the future! And while development has been paused on Reason while I get demolished by my school, I'm still thinking about it. A lot. Some new ideas. So look forward to that this summer if you care about that project. Thank you for checking out Feisty!
